This article focuses on visual tools to represent IT architectures and resources for those tools.

## What I use

Tools for Ad-hoc communication, drafting, and wireframing:

- https://excalidraw.com/
- https://www.figma.com/figjam/
- https://miro.com/
- https://xmind.app/ (MindMaps)

Tools to transform drafts to more presentable assets:

- [draw.io](https://draw.io)
- [Microsoft Visio](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/visio/flowchart-software)

Tools for use in documentation (Diagrams as a Code):

- [Mermaid Playground](https://www.mermaidchart.com/play)

## What I use, As an Azure Consultant:

- In Enterprise world many documentation is done with [Microsoft Visio](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/visio/flowchart-software)
- Azure Services Icons from [Azure-Design repository](https://github.com/David-Summers/Azure-Design)
- [Official Azure Icons from Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/icons/)  
- Visio files could be found in architectures from [Azure Architecture Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/browse/)

## Other

To make visual communication clear we need to decide on style and configure out tools:

- Color scheme
- Rounding
- Fonts

That is why it is import to look around, analyze, and compare. When you look to graphic designer, photographer courses you you always find a section about "collecting inspirations", "observation and others work observation", "designer eye training".

Here I like to maintain my collection for observability:

- [Tools section in Awesome Software Architecture](https://github.com/simskij/awesome-software-architecture?tab=readme-ov-file#tools)
- [Principal Based Enterprise Architecture (PBEA) stencils](https://pbea.iankoenig.com/visio.php)
- [Archi - Archimate Tool](https://www.archimatetool.com/)
- [Eraser](https://www.eraser.io/)
- [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/)
